<h1> Drawbot</h1>
<p class="titles">The Good</p>
<div class="content">They’re right, it’s a great way to learn code! What’s nice about it is that there’s a language (python) used, that’s not one that only suits the application or has just a slight different programming language, in that way you don’t feel like it’s wasted time really getting into Python, also for the sake of using this app. They kept it very simple, which might be a bit intimidating at first as this way it’s only you and the editor, who is waiting for your code to run. Luckily there’s a whole documentation on their website, a manual inside the app, a forum, a couple of videos for tutorials and the best part (!) a tumblr that shares creations made with drawbot. Lots of the time the source code is shared, so in this way you can also practice, by trying to understand someone else code! I very much liked these beginning lessons I found on the forum under the topic “tutorials” “Stephen Nixon's blogified class notes: a useful beginners' DrawBot tutorial” I also liked this part that is written inside these class notes “Use the Courseware in the Docs. If you get stuck or zoned out, don’t waste a whole evening trying to get unstuck – reach out for help to get unstuck. It may be a simple thing – don’t waste too much time on it.” and this one: “Code is about breaking down your ideas into smaller and smaller components. Don’t think “I want to make a font editor;” think, “how do i make a rectangle?”” You start out with good vibes! :)
You can import Python libraries.</div>
<p class="titles">The Bad</p>
<div class="content">It’s only made for Mac OS X. There’s a lot of information (+tutorial) scattered on three websites (GitHub, tumblr, throughout the website itself) It might be handier to find all info on tutorials, lessons for beginners at one spot. It’s made for people to learn, so organise the material that is useful for someone to learn. That’s the only thing I can ‘complain’ about right now. Oh! One more: hard to find tutorials on youtube as the word drawbot is also used for an actual drawbot, so expect lots of robot and arduino related tutorials on youtube when looking for one.
Add notes after trying app for while:
* it’s hard to find specific questions as f.e. “How do I center a bunch of lines” as there isn’t really a stack overflow or w3schools for drawbot. I know it’s written in python, but googling on “center lines python” you get very intense codes, not something as simple as drawbot. This made it harder to figure out
* Also, some lines of code didn’t work, I don’t understand if it’s because of the version of drawbot I have, or maybe because I’m missing a certain ‘library’ maybe? I don’t think it’s actually my mistake, as I followed an exact tutorial and they printed a valuable, which worked, but with me “print” wasn’t recognised.</div>
<p class="titles">The Bottom Line</p>
<div class="content">It’s a learning curve but definitely doable if you’re interest lies in coding and getting better at this! It’s nice that there are places where you can ask questions and talk about bugs, but this isn’t as ‘known’ as f.e. questions on javascript, therefore it’s harder to find specific questions. (Or you’ll have to ask yourself, I don’t know how fast there’ll be a response). Finally I don’t understand why some code terms written in the quick reference and used in the tutorial don’t work for me.</div>
