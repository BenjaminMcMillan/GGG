<p class="titles">The Bad</p>
<div class="content">Difficulty finding freelance jobs, Projects don't shine unless you use ProSite, No safety information or dispute resolution, No ratings for companies. Sometimes hard to get views on your work unless featured or actively liking other projects.</div>
<p class="titles">The Bottom Line</p>
<div class="content">Behance offers an attractive, interactive way for creative professionals to post their work, search for customers, and apply for jobs. With its large membership and active jobs board, Behance is an excellent place for creatives to get their work noticed. Freelancers who search for jobs on Behance should be aware that the company does not involve itself in negotiations between the freelancers and the companies posting the jobs or assist with dispute resolution.
This site is a way for Adobe Systems to market its products, so they want you to use ProSite to create your projects. If you have a lot of visual creative work to share, paying the monthly fee to post your ProSite projects may be a good choice to get your work viewed by Adobe and the creative community. If you don't want to spend the money to post your projects with ProSite, you can post them for free, but with limited design functionality.</div>
